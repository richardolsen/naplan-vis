## Synopsis

Work in progress that allows the visualisation of NAPLAN data. Works with the outcomes level csv files and question level csv file. Allows the visualisation of errors that effect the NAPLAN data, 1) student errors, and 2) test errors.

## Motivation

I wanted a way to communicate to my colleagues at school about how NAPLAN data is based on probabilities not cold hard scores.

## Installation

This project uses angularjs (ver 1), you probably need a webserver but could also be served from something like s3.

## Demo
You can see a demo at: https://www.richardolsen.me/naplan/getting-started

## Contributors

The 2017 data isn't out yet, so I've had to approximate it. There are many holes, which will probably cause some of you data not to work. Please reach out if you can fill out the 2017 equivalence tables, or if you have insight into the 25% and 75% percentile boundaries for relative growth (ACARA does not release this).
